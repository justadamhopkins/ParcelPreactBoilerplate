A boilerplate built in the following technologies:

Preact a lightweight alternative to React for the front end
Apollo Client for state management of my GraphQL server
Apollo Server for building my GraphQL api
Styled components for styling the application
Netlify Lambda for serving and building of my GraphQL api layer
Netlify for hosting and serving my app aswell as their CI/CD pipeline. You should be able to duplicate this boilerplate, setup your own project with a netlify account and get hosting out of the box with the configuration found in netlify.toml file.
Jest as my testing framework
Preact testing library for component testing
Parcel JS for serving and building of my client side code

Local Development:

npm run start

Build for production:

npm run build

If you use Netlify it will build and host out of the box for you as part of their free CI/CD pipeline.

Now go build something exciting!!
